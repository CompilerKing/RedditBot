# RedditBot
First attempt at a Reddit bot in Python, as well as using GitHub. 

First attempt at using Python. Making a reddit bot seemed like a good way to learn a little bit. Currently the function is to correct common mispellings of the word definitely in the comments section of posts by replying to the comment.

To run from cmd: 
  1) While in directory where the file is saved type: python "file name" (without the quotes and including the .py extension)
  2) Enter the username and password of the account you want to run the robot on.
